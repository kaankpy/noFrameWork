# noFramework Multi-Agent System

A lightweight, framework-free agentic system in Python designed to execute complex tasks by planning and coordinating multiple agents and tools.

Example Agent(Computer Evaluator and it's tools have been uploaded)

## Features

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Easily define and load different agents with their own system prompts and configurations from JSON files.
- **Dynamic Tool Integration**: Automatically discovers and utilizes Python functions as tools to extend capabilities.
- **LLM-powered Planning**: An orchestrator agent uses an LLM to generate a step-by-step plan to fulfill user requests.
- **Dependency-Aware Execution**: The executor processes plan steps in the correct order, respecting dependencies between them.
- **Response Generation**: A responder agent synthesizes the results of the execution into a final, helpful response for the user.
- **Persistent Memory & Logging**: Uses a single SQLite database to store both conversation history and structured application logs.
- **Configurable**: Easily adjust LLM models, API keys, and other parameters via a `config.json` file.
- **Robustness**: Includes retry mechanisms for LLM calls.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd noFramework
    ```

2.  **Create a `config.json` file:**
    Copy the `config.json` example provided in the repository and fill in your LLM API key and desired model names.

## Agent Configuration (`agent.json`)

Each agent in the `Agents/` directory is defined by a `.json` configuration file. This file specifies the agent's behavior, the language model it uses, and the tools it has access to.

Here is a breakdown of the `agent.json` file structure:

### Top-Level Properties

*   **`name`**: (string) A unique identifier for the agent (e.g., `"computer_evaluation"`). This is used to select and invoke the agent.
*   **`model`**: (string) The identifier for the language model to be used by the agent (e.g., `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`).
*   **`description`**: (string) A concise summary of the agent's purpose and capabilities. This helps the system select the right agent for a given task.
*   **`temperature`**: (float) A value between 0.0 and 2.0 that controls the randomness of the model's output. Higher values (e.g., `0.8`) result in more creative responses, while lower values produce more deterministic outputs.
*   **`system_prompt`**: (string) The instructions given to the language model to define its persona, role, and the rules it must follow. It sets the context for the agent's responses.

### `related_tools`

This is an array of objects, where each object defines a tool available to the agent. The agent's logic will decide which of these tools are necessary to fulfill a user's request based on their descriptions.

*   **`name`**: (string) The name of the tool function to be called (e.g., `"get_os_info"`).
*   **`description`**: (string) A clear description of what the tool does. This is crucial for the agent to understand when to use the tool.
*   **`expected_params`**: (array of strings) A list of parameters that the tool function expects. If the tool takes no parameters, this should be an empty array `[]`.

### Example `agent.json`

Here is a snippet from `Agents/computer_evaluation.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "computer_evaluation",
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "description": "Agent that answers questions about the user's computer...",
  "temperature": 0.8,
  "system_prompt": "You are a computer evaluation agent...",
  "related_tools": [
    {
      "name": "get_os_info",
      "description": "Retrieves information about the operating system.",
      "expected_params": []
    },
    {
      "name": "get_cpu_info",
      "description": "Retrieves information about the CPU.",
      "expected_params": []
    }
  ]
}
```
