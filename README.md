# Agentic System

This project implements a basic agentic system that can plan and execute tasks based on user input. It leverages large language models (LLMs) for planning and response generation, and integrates with various tools and agents to perform specific actions.

## Features

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Easily define and load different agents with their own system prompts and configurations.
- **Dynamic Tool Integration**: Discover and utilize external Python scripts as tools to extend capabilities (e.g., getting system information).
- **LLM-powered Planning**: An orchestrator agent uses an LLM to generate a step-by-step plan to fulfill user requests.
- **Execution Engine**: Executes the planned steps, coordinating between agents and tools.
- **Response Generation**: A responder agent synthesizes the results of the execution into a final, helpful response for the user.
- **Conversation Memory**: Stores user messages, agent responses, and tool outputs in a SQLite database for context and logging.
- **Configurable**: Easily adjust LLM models, API keys, and other parameters via a `config.json` file.
- **Robustness**: Includes retry mechanisms for LLM calls.
